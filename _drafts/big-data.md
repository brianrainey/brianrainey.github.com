Jen and I recently went to The Coop to pick a book each. By surprising
coincidence, we ended up with quite a complementary selection.

For me, Big Data. It's a non-fictional look at the implications of the
relentless collection and analysis of data (much of it personal). It's
worth reading for lots of reasons. For me, the most interesting idea
was that given practically *all* the data and sufficient processing
power, it's no longer necessary to create a hypothesis. Using
sufficiently sophisticated analysis, it's possible to find
correlations without any obvious causation. It's powerful (albeit
potentially unnerving) to realise that the data can tell a story noone
could have proposed or anticipated at the time of collection.

Add to this Jen's pick, The Circle, and the potential for disaster is
clear for all to see. Set in a near future ...
