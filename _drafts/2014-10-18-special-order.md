As a [Netrunner][1] fan and efficiency geek, I've never been too happy
with the workflow whenever I'm reading some Netrunner forum, see a
card name, copy that text, paste it in to [netrunnerdb.com][2], see
the card in a new tab ... you get the idea.

Special order is a Firefox Addon that aims to simplify the
process. After installing, just highlight a card name on any web page,
watch the toolbar icon light up (blue for Corp, red for Runner) and
then click the button to see the card, without ever leaving the page.

It's an easy one-click install over at [addons.mozilla.org][3].
