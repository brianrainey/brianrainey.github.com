title: The Setup
---

Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) and
[My Linux Rig](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/tagged/the_linux_setup),
this is my setup.

### What hardware do I use? ###

My main [battlestation](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations) is a
machine I proudly built myself from
[these components](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/brianrainey/saved/y4D2FT).
Originally a [Hackintosh](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php), it's
currently running [Xubuntu](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php). My
keyboard is a
[Ducky Shine 3](http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Shine_3_DK9008.html)
with Cherry MX Brown switches, my mouse is the
[Logitech M705](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705)
and it all sits atop an
[Ikea Galant](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89806740/#/S29836976)
desk.

My personal laptop is a
[13" MacBook Air](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP683), the perfect size
for a laptop and still every bit as good as the day I bought it. I get
my day job done on a
[Lenovo x201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x201). It's
small, sturdy and can still handle all I throw at it after nearly 4
years. It runs Linux wonderfully (currently
[Xubuntu 14.01](http://xubuntu.org/)).

The books I like to read are most often instructional, so E Ink rarely
does them justice. A [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/7/) does
solid duty as my reader. My phone has been an iPhone for some time,
and that's unlikely to change. I replaced the stock earbuds with some
[Sonys](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BXEQXC6/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
and have never looked back.

Nothing of any significance gets done without my
[Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/plain-notebook-large)
and
[pencil](http://www.waterman.com/en/hemisphere/183-stainless-steel-mechanical-pencil-ct-3501170920497.html). I'd
be surprised if anyone but me could make sense of the scribblings; I
use it like RAM for the ageing HDD that is my brain.

### And what software? ###

I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/) for as
much as I can, across every OS --
[the open web's important](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/)!

I code and blog using [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I
got fed up trying to keep the combination of Brew and XCode up to date
on my Mac, so that machine has a headless
[Debian](http://www.debian.org/) testing
[VM](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for all my coding needs. I
[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) to the VM from the
OSX terminal and it all works beautifully. The Emacs /
[TMUX](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) combination means I can do pretty
much whatever I want from a single SSH session.

[Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) on iOS and OSX is by
far my favourite Twitter
client. [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts)
is probably the most important app on my phone.

I'm rather addicted to
[Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/), so that's always
a click away on the Mac.

This [blog](https://github.com/brianrainey/brianrainey.github.com)
runs on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and I've put in
some amount of time with the
[Clojure Koans](https://github.com/brianrainey/clojure-koans)
recently.

### What would be my dream setup? ###

In the not too distant future, we'll look back and laugh at
multi-monitor setups. I'm looking forward to affordable large high-res
screens. Beyond that, I'm happy with my current setup. Something that
syncs all my machines better than my current
[Github](https://github.com/) / [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
combination would be the icing on the cake.
