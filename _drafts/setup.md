title: The Setup
---

Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) and
[My Linux Rig](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/tagged/the_linux_setup),
this is my setup.

**What hardware do I use?**

My main [battlestation](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations) is a
machine I proudly built myself from
[these components](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/brianrainey/saved/y4D2FT).
Originally a [Hackintosh](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php), it's
currently running [Xubuntu](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php). My
keyboard is a
[Ducky Shine 3](http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Shine_3_DK9008.html)
with Cherry MX Brown switches, my mouse is the
[Logitech M705](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705)
and it all sits atop an
[Ikea Galant](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89806740/#/S29836976)
desk.

My personal laptop is a
[13" MacBook Air](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP683), the perfect size
for a laptop and still every bit as good as the day I bought it. I get
my day job done on a
[Lenovo x201](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x201). It's
small, sturdy and can still handle all I throw at it after nearly 4
years. It runs Linux wonderfully (currently
[Xubuntu 14.01](http://xubuntu.org/)).

The books I like to read are most often instructional, so E Ink rarely
does them justice. A [Nexus 7](http://www.google.com/nexus/7/) does
solid duty as my reader. My phone has been an iPhone for some time,
and that's unlikely to change.

Nothing of any significance gets done without my
[Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/plain-notebook-large)
and
[pencil](http://www.waterman.com/en/hemisphere/183-stainless-steel-mechanical-pencil-ct-3501170920497.html). I'd
be surprised if anyone but me could make sense of the scribblings; I
use it like RAM for the ageing HDD that is my brain.

**And what software?**

I use Firefox for as much as I can, across every OS -- the open web's
important!

I code and blog using Emacs. I got fed up trying to keep the
combination of Brew and XCode up to date on my mac, so that machine
has a headless Debian testing VM for all my coding needs. I SSH to the
VM from the OSX terminal and it all works beautifully. The Emacs /
TMUX combination means I can do pretty much whatever I want from a
single SSH session.

Tweetbot on iOS and OSX is by far my favourite Twitter client.

I'm rather addicted to Hearthstone, so that's always a click away on
the Mac.

This blog runs on Jekyll and I've put in some amount of time with the
Clojure Koans recently.

**What would be my dream setup?**
