title: The Setup
---

Inspired by [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) and its quirky cousin
[My Linux Rig](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/tagged/the_linux_setup),
here's my setup, here's what I use to get things done.

**What hardware do I use?**

My main [battlestation](http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations) is a
machine I proudly built myself from
[these components](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/brianrainey/saved/y4D2FT).
Originally a [Hackintosh](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php), it's
currently running [Xubuntu](http://www.tonymacx86.com/home.php). My
keyboard is a
[Ducky Shine 3](http://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Shine_3_DK9008.html)
with Cherry MX Brown switches, my mouse is the
[Logitech M705](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/marathon-mouse-m705)
and it all sits atop an
[Ikea Galant](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89806740/#/S29836976)
desk.

My laptop is a mid 2011 MacBook Air, still every bit as good as the
day I bought it.

I get my day job done on a Lenovo x201. It's small, sturdy and can
still handle all I throw aat it after nearly 4 years.

I have a Nexus 7 that I use as my eBook reader. I mostly read
instructional books; E Ink never does them justice.

For some years, my phone was and will continue to be an iPhone. 

Nothing of any significance gets done without my Moleskine and
pencil. I'd be surprised if anyone but me could make sense of the
scribblings; I use it like RAM for the ageing HDD that is my brain.

**And what software?**



**What would be my dream setup?**
