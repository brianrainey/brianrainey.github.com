title: The Best Player You're Not Watching
---

As we watched the Revs' 2-1 win to go top of the conference this
weekend, I genuinely started to wonder why Lee Nguyen never gets
mentioned as a candidate for the US Men's National Team.

It's good to see I wasn't the only one.

[The best MLS player you're not watching plays for the New England
Revolution](http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/03/03/armchair-analyst-best-mls-player-youre-not-watching-plays-new-england-revolu?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=News&utm_campaign=Unpaid),
is a fantastic anaylsis of the current state of the Revs.

> Gon√ßalves, Agudelo, Fagundez and Rowe were, in that order, the four
  best players on the Revs last year. They've had to find new answers
  so far in 2014, and as Saturday's 2-1 win at Toronto FC showed,
  they're getting them through defensive aggression, tactical
  adjustments, and individual brilliance

Another thing I like about Nguyen is that he's scored 3 pressure
penalties in 3 weeks, calmly nailing each one in to a different
corner.
