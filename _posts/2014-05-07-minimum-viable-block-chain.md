title: Minimum Viable Block Chain
---

[Minimum Viable Block
Chain](http://www.igvita.com/2014/05/05/minimum-viable-block-chain/),
is the best explanation I've seen of how and why the technology behind
bitcoin works.

It takes a while to get through it all, but it's time well spent. 

> The combination of all of the above rules and infrastructure
  provides a decentralized, peer-to-peer block chain for achieving
  distributed consensus of ordering of signed transactions. That's a
  mouthful, I know, but it's also an ingenious solution to a very hard
  problem. The individual pieces of the block-chain (accounting,
  cryptography, networking, proof-of-work), are not new, but the
  emergent properties of the system when all of them are combined are
  pretty remarkable.

Properly understanding this infrastructure is a necessary first step
in understanding other potential uses for the technology. There are
sure to be some interesting ideas as this all pans out.
