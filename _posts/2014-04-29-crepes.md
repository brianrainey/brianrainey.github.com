title: The Only Cr&ecirc;pe Batter Worth Making

Pancake Tuesday’s been and gone, and this is the only recipe I can
ever get to work.

* 5 oz Plain Flour
* 1/2 Pint of Milk
* 1 Whole Egg
* 1 Egg Yolk
* 1 Tablespoon of Oil

Mix everything together in a big bowl. Use a spoon first, then a
whisk. Get all the lumps out; strain it through a sieve for good
measure. Put some oil on a frying pan over a medium to high heat. When
it’s heated, get rid of the oil, wipe the pan with kitchen roll. Off
the heat, put about half a ladle of the batter in the pan. Swirl
quickly to spread out. Put it back on the heat. When it starts to
bubble on the top, use a spoon to loosen round the edges. When it’s
cooked enough underneath, it should come away easily enough. Check
that it’s nicely browned underneath then flip it. Cook the other
side. Good with ice cream.
