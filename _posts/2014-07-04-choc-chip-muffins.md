title: Choc Chip Muffins

I tweaked this a bit from a Cadbury’s recipe. It makes about 10
sensible muffins.

* 355 ml plain flour
* 3 tablespoons cocoa (Borneville’s best – makes the muffins look more chocolate-y)
* 1/2  tablespoon baking powder
* 180ml brown sugar
* 100g chopped chocolate (I like Dairy Milk, use more than 100g if you feel like it)
* 180ml milk
* 60g melted butter
* 1 egg lightly beaten

Mix it all well in a big bowl – no lumps (except for choc chips!). Put
muffin cases into a muffin tray and scoop some mixture into each
one. I think it works best if you fill to about 1cm from the top of
each case. Oven 180 °C for 20 mins tops. I like to turn the tray half
way through to make sure they cook evenly. Eat at least one while
they’re still warm.
