Bruce Schneier's security blog is perhaps my favourite example of Einstein's famous quote.

[The Internet of Things Will Be the World's Biggest Robot.][1]

Like many tech neologisms, I've often found "IOT" frustratingly vague. Schneier distills it down to its essence and paints a wonderful picture of how it applies to our lives in the very near future.

I suggest _not_ watching [Ex Machina][2] too soon after reading his post.
