It's coming close to that time where, once every four years, young me
would begin to turn his obsessive attention towards [World
Cup](http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/index.html) sticker albums.

Even nowadays as a more rational thirtysomething, seeing
"[Panini](https://store.paniniamerica.net)" on a coffee shop menu
evokes memories of scoring a good foiler over anything to do with a
hard, overpriced sandwich.

I can't quite remember when I concluded I was too old for it all but
even now, I'm a sucker for a one-off magazine -- anything with a score
chart and some useless factoids about the Irans and Algerias of the
tournament.

Needless to say, in this digital age, Howler has it covered with their
[World Cup Crash
Course](http://www.howlermagazine.com/wc-crash-course-1/).

I'll probably still buy some stickers though.
