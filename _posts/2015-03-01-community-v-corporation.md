corporations][1].

I've been gradually moving away from Google in particular over the
past year. My mail is now on [Fastmail][2], my calendar on
[Outlook.com][3] (I'm less convinced that Microsoft remain a
"default"), whenever possible my OS is some flavour of [Linux][4], and
I love to [build my own PCs][5]. It's not the easy path, but it's
definitely worthwile and rewarding.
