title: On Fellow Expat Jony Ive
---

There'a a lot to like about [Time's interview with Jony
Ive](http://time.com/jonathan-ive-apple-interview/). My personal
favourite:

> He speaks slowly and softly in an Essex accent totally unaffected by
  living in America for more than two decades. “I can’t even bring
  myself to say math, instead of maths, so I say mathematics. I sound
  ridiculous,” he laughs.

I'm slowly losing the ability to get my mouth around "maths" and only
yesterday concluded that "mathematics" could be the way to go. If only
all my decisions were as spectacular as his.
