The [World Football Statue
Database](http://www.offbeat.group.shef.ac.uk/statues/database_footballmaps.htm)
has a map of over 350 football statues from all over the world.

Word has it there are SIX
[Pel�s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel%C3%A9) to be found. I'm also
surprised to have never noticed the
[Eus�bio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eus%C3%A9bio) at Gillette
Stadium.
