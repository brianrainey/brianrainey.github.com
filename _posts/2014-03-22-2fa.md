The story of how [@N recently lost his Twitter
handle](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/02/twitter-restores-50000-n-username-to-its-owner/)
is typical of increasing evidence that passwords alone are becoming
ineffective as a means of protecting our data and identities online.

[Two Factor Auth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification)
(2FA) seems annoyingly inconvenient at first, but in my experience
(with Google, App.net and Twitter) using it soon becomes second
nature.

This [list of services providing 2FA](http://twofactorauth.org/) is a
great resource that seems to be growing by the day. In the absence of
any radically new and substantially more secure method of
authentication, 2FA should rapidly become the norm. 

Might as well get on board sooner than later.
