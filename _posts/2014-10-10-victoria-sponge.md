This is my mum’s “go to” cake. Easy and tasty.

* 8 oz self raising flower
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 8 oz castor sugar
* 8 oz soft butter
* 4 eggs

Have the butter soft; ideally left out overnight. Cream it together
with the sugar then add the remaining ingredients and combine well
without beating too much. Divide the mixture between 2 cake tins (8.5
x 8.5 or so). Bake in the oven at 180 ºC (350 fahrenheit) for
approximately 25 minutes. Let the halves cool, then sandwich them
together with jam (or fruit) and cream.
