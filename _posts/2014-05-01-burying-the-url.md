title: Burying the URL
---

Back in the 90s as I was trying to understand what the Internet was
and Björk ruled the charts, Ms Guðmundsdóttir saw fit to include the
address of her _website_ on a CD.

I can't remember the exact URL, but it began with `http:////`. An
obvious typo in hindsight, at the time it set back my understanding of
the Internet by months.

In those days, it wasn't uncommon to tell someone the address of the
latest "cool website" by actually calling out the
"ache-tee-tee-pee-colon-forward-slash-forward-slash" tongue twister
the start.

Few noticed and fewer still complained whenever browsers eventually
eliminated the need to type this protocol part of the URL. The
Internet was easier and all was good.

Fast forward 20 years or so, and Google is taking steps that may turn
out to be the end for the entire URL in the address bar.

[Allen Pike sums it up nicely](http://www.allenpike.com/2014/burying-the-url/).

As someone who fought so hard to open Björk's website all those years
ago, I'll want to hack URLs for the rest of my days. Looks like I
should make the most of it while I still can.
