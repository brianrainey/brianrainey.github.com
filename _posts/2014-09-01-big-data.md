Jen and I recently went to [The Coop][coop] to pick a book each. By
surprising coincidence, we ended up with a rather complementary
selection.

For me, [Big Data][big-data]. It's a non-fictional look at the
implications of the relentless collection and analysis of data (much
of it personal). It's worth reading for lots of reasons. What I found
most interesting was that given practically *all* the data and
sufficient processing power, it's no longer necessary to create a
hypothesis. Using sufficiently sophisticated analysis, it's possible
to find correlations without any obvious causation. The notion that
the data may tell a story no one could have anticipated at the time of
its collection, underlines the trust we place in those who collect it.

Add to this Jen's pick, [The Circle][circle], and the potential for
disaster is clear for all to see. Set in the near future, the novel
follows a young, technically proficient protagonist as her career
progresses at a company intent on cataloging the world's data via
omnipresent cameras, single sign on credentials and a popular culture
obsessed with sharing. Ostensibly all for the greater good, I'll leave
you to imagine how the story pans out.

Both books come highly recommended, and if anybody needs me, I'll be
busy spreading my online data across as many disparate services as I
can find!
