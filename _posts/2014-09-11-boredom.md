title: The Lost Art of Being Bored

Having recently decided to restrict my social media consumption to 30
minutes per day, I've been re-discovering what it's like to encounter
random, small windows of free time.

It's amazing how time that would have been spent mindlessly scrolling
through Tweets or checking Facebook, can now be the start of reading a
book, writing some code, or even ... sitting quietly.

Never the type to
[shock myself rather than be alone with my thoughts][1], I was
nonetheless surprised to discover that life had become very short of
opportunities to deliberate over what I would do next.

Against that backdrop, I stumbled across
["Bored at Work? Good"][2]. The principles are equally applicable to
life outside work.

Who would ever have thought boredom could be so exciting!
