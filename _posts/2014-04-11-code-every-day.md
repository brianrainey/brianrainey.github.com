title: Code Every Day

Coding hero [John Resig](http://ejohn.org) (without whom there's be no
[jQuery](http://jquery.com)) on the idea of [writing code every
day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/):

> There were a few major problems with how I was working on my side
  projects. I was primarily working on them during the weekends and
  sometimes in the evenings during the week. This is a strategy that
  does not work well for me, as it turns out.

Much of what he writes is good general advice on learning and forming
positive habits. One commenter points out the similarity to [Jerry
Seinfeld's productivity
secret](http://lifehacker.com/5886128/how-seinfelds-productivity-secret-fixed-my-procrastination-problem).

All in all, it might just give me the inspiration I need to finally
finish the [Clojure
Koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans).
