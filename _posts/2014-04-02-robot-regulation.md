title: Robot Regulation
---

I've been reading more and more [Cory
Doctorow](https://twitter.com/doctorow) lately. Today he has an
article in The Guardian about [regulating
robots](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/apr/02/why-it-is-not-possible-to-regulate-robots).

> Practically speaking, though, these all amount to the same question:
  how do we keep computers from executing certain instructions, even
  if the people who own those computers want to execute them? And the
  practical answer is, we can't.

I find almost everything Doctorow writes to be food for thought. If
you enjoy the general style and content of this article, try
