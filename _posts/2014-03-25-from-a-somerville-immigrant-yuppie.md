title: From a Somerville Immigrant Yuppie
---

> There are often rumors that the Revs are looking to build a stadium somewhere north of Boston, where scads of yuppies and immigrants—the perfect soccer demographic!—live densely packed side by side.

As a Somerville immigrant who no doubt counts as a yuppie by someone's standards, it should come as no surprise that a "soccer specific stadium" close to Boston would be my dream come true.

Having been through some [dark days](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/northern_ireland/3503257.stm) as a Northern Ireland fan, I've seen the effect that a compact stadium full of enthusiastic support can have on a team's on-field fortunes. 

It's no coincidence that as the [Football For All](https://www.facebook.com/FootballforAllNI) campaign began to make an impact in the stands, the team itself quickly rose in the FIFA rankings by an unbelieveable [71 places in the space of 2 years](http://en.fifaranking.net/nations/nir/ranking_d.php).

[The Krafts Are the Worst Owners in the League](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/article/2014/03/25/bob-kraft-worst-owner-new-england-revolution/) is a fantastic read for anyone interested in New England soccer or the evolution of MLS.

Clearly, moving the Revs would be a financial gamble ... but it's one the owners can afford to lose and the benefits are potentially huge.
