International Master [Jeremy Silman][1] on how the perception of one
of his best known chess books was altered in the age of strong chess
computers:

> Chess engines and databases weren’t around when I wrote that book

> As a result, the Amateur’s Mind was filled with errors. And, of

> But, that’s completely wrong. The Amateur’s Mind is an exceptionally

That potentially destructive urge to be "right" above all else,
recently reared its head when a now infamous Harvard professor chose
to relentlessly bully a small Chinese restaurant over a 
[billing error][2].

A recent Wired article, ["It's Actually Smart to Be Mean Online"][3],
attempts to explain:

So are all attempts to appear intelligent _and_ nice doomed to
failure?  Against the odds, I'm determined to try!
