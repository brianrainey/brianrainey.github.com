> As the UK organisation Action for Happiness likes to point out, one
  of the biggest causes of misery is the way we chronically "compare
  our insides with other people's outsides". We're all mini-New York
  Timeses or White Houses, energetically projecting an image of calm
  proficiency, while inside we're improvising in a mad panic. Yet we
  forget (especially in an era of carefully curated Facebook profiles
  and suchlike) that everyone else is doing the same thing. The only
  difference is that they think it's you who's truly competent.

Something I'm sure many of us already suspect, but very eloquently
put.
