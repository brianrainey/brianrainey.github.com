I'm proud and honoured to feature on
[My Linux Rig](http://www.mylinuxrig.com/post/123471753523/the-linux-setup-brian-rainey-software-engineer)
this week.

[Steven](https://twitter.com/steven_ovadia) does such a great job
curating these interviews. His site appeals not only to the Linux geek
in me, but also to the part that's just fascinated by the idea of
computers as customizable, essential tools for getting things done.
