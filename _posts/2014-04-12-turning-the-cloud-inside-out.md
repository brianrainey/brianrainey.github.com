title: Turning The Cloud Inside Out
---

Whatever you think of Bitcoin as a currency, it's difficult to deny
that the underlying technology is impressive.

[How Mobile Is Killing Innovation, And How Blockchain Can Save It](http://http://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/mobile-killing-innovation-html5-blockchain-apple-google#awesm=~oB3kY5JpOqJGzA),
makes a case for Blockchain as a key component in a more open,
decentralized web.

It's an intriguing idea, and contains one link in particular that gets
to the meat of the issue: [How Bitcoin Can Turn The Cloud Inside Out](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/enter-the-blockchain-how-bitcoin-can-turn-the-cloud-inside-out/).

> The “blockchain” — the engine on which Bitcoin is built — is a new
  kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or
  other data, to be securely stored and verified without any
  centralized authority at all, because (to grossly oversimplify) they
  are validated by the entire network. Those transactions don’t have
  to be financial; that data doesn’t have to be money. The engine that
  powers Bitcoin can be used for a whole array of other applications…

That array includes
[Namecoin](http://www.coindesk.com/what-are-namecoins-and-bit-domains/)
(a decentralised DNS) and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) ("a
platform and programming language to build and publish next-generation
distributed applications").

As far in the future as this may be, an internet where peer to peer
technology could be a viable option for our cloud computing needs,
sounds good to me.
