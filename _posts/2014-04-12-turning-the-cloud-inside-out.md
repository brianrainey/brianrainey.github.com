title: Turning The Cloud Inside Out
---

Whatever you think of Bitcoin as a currency, it's difficult to deny
that the underlying technology is impressive.

[How Mobile Is Killing Innovation, And How Blockchain Can Save
It](http://http://readwrite.com/2014/04/10/mobile-killing-innovation-html5-blockchain-apple-google#awesm=~oB3kY5JpOqJGzA)
attempts to make a case for Blockchain as a key component in a more
open, decentralized web.

It's an intriguing idea, but the article is ultimately too vague to
provide any useful information. It's unclear if the author is
proposing Blockchain as an alternative to distribution, payment or
[PaaS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) ... and how
or why any of this would be allowed to exist on our current mobile
hardware.

Some digging, does however provide further context. The link to [How
Bitcoin Can Turn The Cloud Inside
Out](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/enter-the-blockchain-how-bitcoin-can-turn-the-cloud-inside-out/)
gets to the real meat of the issue:

> The “blockchain” — the engine on which Bitcoin is built — is a new
  kind of distributed consensus system that allows transactions, or
  other data, to be securely stored and verified without any
  centralized authority at all, because (to grossly oversimplify) they
  are validated by the entire network. Those transactions don’t have
  to be financial; that data doesn’t have to be money. The engine that
  powers Bitcoin can be used for a whole array of other applications…

That array includes
[Namecoin](http://www.coindesk.com/what-are-namecoins-and-bit-domains/)
(a decentralised DNS) and [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) ("a
platform and programming language to build and publish next-generation
distributed applications").

As far in the future as this may be, an internet where peer to peer
technology could provide a viable alternative to trusting the Googles,
Apples and Amazons with our cloud computing needs, sounds good to me.
