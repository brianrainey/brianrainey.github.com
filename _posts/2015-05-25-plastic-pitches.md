As a kid, I grew up dreaming of some day playing football at
Wembley. This wasn't born out of desire for fame or fortune, but
rather desire to play on the best surface our ten year old minds knew
existed. Those years were spent playing in cul-de-sacs, parks and
church halls. My one trip to Wembley, unsurprisingly didn't put me
anywhere near the hallowed turf itself.

As an amateur, today's plastic pitches are by far the best surfaces
I've ever played on. And they're everywhere.

As a fan, my local New England Revolution play the best passing
football of any team I've ever cared about, on plastic.
