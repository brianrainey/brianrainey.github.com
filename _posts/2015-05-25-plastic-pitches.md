As a kid, I grew up dreaming of some day playing football at
Wembley. I didn't want fame or fortune, I just wanted to strut my
stuff on what I knew was the best surface available. Making do with
cul-de-sacs, parks and church halls, my one school trip to Wembley
didn't put me anywhere near the hallowed turf itself.

These days I have easy access to plastic pitches that young me would
never have dreamed possible. My local New England Revolution produce a
beautiful, often successful style of passing football on FieldTurf.

[It's time to destigmatize plastic pitches][1].
