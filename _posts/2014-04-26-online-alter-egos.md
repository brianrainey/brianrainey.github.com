Having always taken a certain pride in consistency and accountability,
the idea of online pseudonyms has never sat too easy with me.

[We Need Online Alter Egos Now More Than
Ever](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/why-we-need-online-alter-egos-now-more-than-ever/)
highlights how, whether we realise it or not, the barriers of space
and time have always helped us to segment our various real world
identities.

  coming ubiquity of cameras everywhere combined with face recognition
  means that the taken-for-granted ability to facet our lives in the
  physical world may be coming to an end.

  if we have established a tradition of pseudonymity and ensured that
  there remain places where one can participate without identifying
  one’s real world self.

Yet one more factor to consider in the complex domain of online
identity.
