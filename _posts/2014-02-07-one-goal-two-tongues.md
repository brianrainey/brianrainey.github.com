title: One Goal, Two Tongues
---

I happily subscribed to Howler Magazine after reading this piece on
[Diego Maradona's famous
goal](http://www.howlermagazine.com/what-planet-are-you-from/) at the
'86 World Cup .

> In the 51st minute, the Hand of God beat the hand of Shilton. Only
  four minutes later, while the outrage of English fans and players
  was still raw, El Diego received the ball in his own half, facing
  his own net. It took him 11 touches and 10.6 seconds to beat six
  opponents—Beardsley, Reid, Butcher (twice), Fenwick, and the
  goalkeeper, Shilton—and bury what many consider to be the greatest
  goal of all time.

However many times I watch it, I can't understand how "the little
squat man" so easily waltzes past half the England team. 

I remember the BBC commentator's sense of wonder as Maradona
finally slotted the ball past Shilton. What I don't remember is the
contempt with which he described him as he initially picked up the
ball in his own half and how much that attitude would change in the 10
seconds that followed.

'86 was also the last time Northern Ireland went to the World Cup. All
in all, a lot for 10 year old me to take in.
