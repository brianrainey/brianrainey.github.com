Though my new family is as American as apple pie, it was my mum’s
apple *tart* that got voted dessert of the week when they came to
visit us in Belfast. She says all you have to do is follow these
instructions, but everyone suspects she’s adding a touch of *je ne
sais quoi* that the rest of us will never quite manage.

* 10 ounces butter (removed from fridge 30 mins before use)
* 4 ounces sugar
* 1 pound flour
* 4 medium cooking apples

Peel and cut the apples into slices, and place in a medium heat
saucepan along with a tablespoon of water. Once the apples start to
cook down, sweeten to taste and allow to cool.

Put butter, sugar and flour into mixer and slowly combine until it
comes together (don’t over mix, or it will get too soft). Empty
mixture on to floured work surface, divide in two and roll out to a
thickness of about 5mm. Use the first half to line a lightly buttered
pie tin (metal is best) and add the cooked apples. Place the second
half of rolled out pastry on top and use a knife to cut round the tin,
ensuring a nice round pie. Seal the edges using your thumb. Poke some
holes (6 or so) in the top with a sharp knife

Cook at 180 celsius, until golden (approximately 30 minutes). Sprinkle
some sugar on top once it’s out of the oven and then allow to cool
before eating.
